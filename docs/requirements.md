# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive network latency prediction system that uses machine learning models to predict network latency based on various network infrastructure and user behavior attributes. The system will implement both vertical and horizontal partitioning strategies to compare different modeling approaches and evaluate their effectiveness in predicting network performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network engineer, I want to predict network latency using infrastructure-related features, so that I can optimize network performance based on technical parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives network infrastructure data (Signal Strength, Network Traffic) THEN the system SHALL create a specialized Model A that processes these features
2. WHEN Model A is trained THEN the system SHALL achieve measurable performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
3. WHEN infrastructure features are provided THEN Model A SHALL output latency predictions with quantified accuracy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a network analyst, I want to predict network latency using user behavior features, so that I can understand how user patterns affect network performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives user behavior data (User Count, Device Type) THEN the system SHALL create a specialized Model B that processes these features
2. WHEN Model B is trained THEN the system SHALL achieve measurable performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
3. WHEN user behavior features are provided THEN Model B SHALL output latency predictions with quantified accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to combine outputs from both infrastructure and user behavior models, so that I can create a comprehensive latency prediction system through vertical partitioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both Model A and Model B generate predictions THEN the system SHALL fuse their outputs using an appropriate combination method
2. WHEN the fused model is evaluated THEN the system SHALL compare its performance against a monolithic model using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
3. WHEN performance comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a performance evaluation table with interpretation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network planner, I want to train separate models for urban and rural environments, so that I can optimize predictions for different geographical contexts through horizontal partitioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dataset contains location information THEN the system SHALL categorize towers into Urban and Rural subsets
2. IF location data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL simulate geographical categorization by manually tagging towers
3. WHEN geographical subsets are created THEN the system SHALL train separate specialized models for each subset
4. WHEN specialized models are trained THEN the system SHALL compare their performance against a global model trained on the full dataset

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to evaluate and compare different partitioning strategies, so that I can determine the most effective approach for network latency prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all models are trained and evaluated THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance comparisons
2. WHEN performance metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL include MAE, RMSE, and R² Score for all model variants
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary findings and recommendations
4. WHEN deliverables are generated THEN the system SHALL produce Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for both vertical and horizontal partitioning implementations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with a structured dataset containing all necessary attributes, so that I can build and test the prediction models effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes input data THEN it SHALL handle the following columns: Tower ID, Signal Strength (dBm), Network Traffic (MB), Latency (ms), User Count, Device Type, Location Type
2. WHEN data preprocessing occurs THEN the system SHALL validate data quality and handle missing values appropriately
3. WHEN features are prepared THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data types and scaling for machine learning models
